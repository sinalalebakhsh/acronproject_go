Make Code cleaner with
package level variables
Defined at the top outside all functions
They can be accesses inside any of the functions
And in all files, which are in the same package
Belike Python language is global variable
Local Variables:
> Difined inside a function or a block
> They can be accessed only inside that function or block of code
=======================================================================================================================
More Use Cases of functions
Another important purpose which is that, same block of code can be reused in many different places in your Application
by calling the function name just like variables where we define something once and reuse it hundred times so far example
if you were hosting 10 conferences at the same time and needed to ask for and validate user input you can reuse that code
for all 10 conferences instead of writing that same login 10 times.
=======================================================================================================================
Packages in Go:
Until now we worked only with 1 file.
What if I'm writing a more complex Go application with a lot of logic?
