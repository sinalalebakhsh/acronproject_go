use a particular type at a particular place in your program.
Go is not an object oriented programming language like Java or C sharp.
Instead, it uses something called composition.
And that's something we need to learn about in a bit more detail.

Category of types:
  ----------------
Basic Types: numbers, strings, booleans.

Aggregate Types: arrays, structs.

Reference Types: Pointers, slices, maps, functions, channels.

Interface Type: The very general type known as the interface type,
    which is a type that can hold literally anything you want for expression's.

Expressions:
    Boolean if
    Compound boolean if 
    switch()

Composition:
    Composition vs. Inheritance
    Go is not OOP
    Example: car is OOP, car with composition.
    ------
    If you have an object oriented programming language,
    you might have something called a class and that class might be occur and you can inherit 
    from that class to create a new class say type ford.
    So you might make a class ford that extends the class cur.
    but:
    with composition you might define your own type called cut 
    and a car would have a steering wheel, tires, seats, an engine.
