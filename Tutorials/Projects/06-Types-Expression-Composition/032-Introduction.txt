use a particular type at a particular place in your program.
Go is not an object oriented programming language like Java or C sharp.
Instead, it uses something called composition.
And that's something we need to learn about in a bit more detail.

Category of types:
  ----------------
Basic Types: numbers, strings, booleans.

Aggregate Types: arrays, structs.

Reference Types: Pointers, slices, maps, functions, channels.

Interface Type: The very general type known as the interface type,
    which is a type that can hold literally anything you want for expression's.

Expressions:
    Boolean if
    Compound boolean if 
    switch()
