Summary:
|    
|    * Basic types - int, float32, float64, boolean, string, rune
|
|    * Aggregate types - arrays, structs
|
|    * Reference types - pointers, slice, maps, function, channel
|
|    * Interface type
|
|    * In order to implement an interface, a type must implement All
|      of the methods of that interface.
|
|    * Boolean expressions - false, num > 10, == != > < >= <=
|
|    * Compound booleans - (x > 10) && (y < 20)
|
|    * Composition - embedding types in types
|
|    * Exported VS. Unexported - capitalization matters for:
    |  
    |   * package level constants
    |
    |   * package level variables
    |
    |   * functions
    |
    |   * types
